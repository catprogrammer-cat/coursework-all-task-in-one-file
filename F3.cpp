Coursework 3, task 1: "Determine if the string contains the letter X (small or large)."
xxxxFAn array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by using an index to a unique identifier.
    ++This string has x
For example, a five element integer array foo may be logically represented as;
    --This string hasn't x/X
the index of the first array element is always zero. As expected, an n array must be declared prior its use. A typical declaration for an array in C++ is:
    --This string hasn't x/X
where type is a valid type (such as int, float ...), name is a valid identifier and the elements field (which is always enclosed in square brackets []), specifies the size of the array.
    --This string hasn't x/X
int foo [5];
    --This string hasn't x/X
: The elements field within square brackets [], representing the number of elementsin the array, must be a constant expression, since arrays are blocks of static memory whose size must be known at co    --This string hasn't x/X
INITIALIZING ARRAYS
    --This string hasn't x/X
The initializer can even have no values, just the braces:
    --This string hasn't x/X
This creates an array of five int values, each initialized with a value of zero:
    --This string hasn't x/X
int foo [5] = { 16, 2, 77, 40, 12071 };  
    --This string hasn't x/X
The number of values between braces {} shall not be greater than the number of elements in the array. For example, in the example above, foo was declared having 5 elements (as specified by the number    --This string hasn't x/X
ntal types, means they are filled with zeroes). For example:
    --This string hasn't x/X
Will create an array like this:
    --This string hasn't x/X
 that matches the number of values included between the braces {}:
    --This string hasn't x/X
After this declaration, array foo would be five int long, since we have provided five initialization values.
    --This string hasn't x/X
oth these statements are equivalent:
    --This string hasn't x/X
int foo[] { 10, 20, 30 }; 
    --This string hasn't x/X
Static arrays, and those declared directly in a namespace (outside any function), are always initialized. If no explicit initializer is specified, all the elements are default-initialized (with zeroe    --This string hasn't x/X
s, for fundamental types).    --This string hasn't x/X
